            <h1> WELCOME TO SESOTHO LEFATS'ENG </h1>
<p> Sesotho lefats'eng is more than just a statement, it's a purpose.
    We aspire to spread the raw, authentic and generic culture of Lesotho onto the world as our motto 
    directly translates to "Sesotho to the world".
    Lesotho is the only independent country in the world that sits 
    entirely above 1000 metres in elevation. Our pride, Africa's mountanious motherland
    and most importantly our priveledged home.

<h1>
    ABOUT LESOTHO
</h1>
<p>
    Without our one and only king Moshoeshoe I, we wouldn't even be here showcasing our gratitude by means of digital platforms
    such as the one you're scrolling through right now. King Moshoeshoe I rightfully and successfully defended his people against
    internal rival clans and foreign formiddable threats to Lesotho such as the boers, zulu and the british. king Moshoeshoe I is celebrated as a wise,
    diplomatic, and visionary leader. No figure compared to him in wisdom and peacemaking in Southern Africa during his reign.
